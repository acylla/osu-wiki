9. If a player disconnects, their score is treated as being 0.
   - Unless the disconnected player has a screenshot with their final score, or the server saved their score before disconnection, so we can compare it to the others.
   - The second exception is when the player is disconnected in first ten seconds of a map. In that case, there will be a rematch. This may only occur once per map, and once per player.
10. Maps cannot be reused in the same match unless the game was nullified.
11. If less than 3 players attend, your Revives will be limited by 1 less, per the round.
12. The Revive System functions are as follows:

    - You may not choose to revive yourself if playing as the last member (1 vs 3, for example).
    - Players may swap freely between each other for each map.

### Tournament Registration

1. Your team needs at least 3 players to participate.
   - The maximum size of a team is 4 players.
   - Teams are not bound to country and can include players from various countries. Schedules will give teams with single or close time zones higher priority over ones with several, spread-apart time zones (for example having a team with players from America, Europe and Asia will be low priority).
   - You must specify a captain who will represent a team.
   - Every player will be informed via PM about the team registration. Don't register teams without aggrement from all players!

2. The Tournament Team involved directly with the map pool may not participate as players in this tournament. This does not include referees, streamers and commentators.
3. The maximum amount of teams is 32.

   - Individual players may also PM the Tournament Management if they are not part of a team yet. The Tournament Management will inform every individually registered player near the end of the registration period about other players.

### Stage Instructions
1. In the first stage (Group Stage), the teams will be divided into 8 groups of 4 teams.
   - If less than 32 teams arrive, the grouping will be set up differently.

3. Rankings of each group are determined by sorting the results of each team's performance in the following priority:
   - More Matches Won.
   - Have higher {(the number of maps won) - (the number of maps defeated)}.
   - Most maps won.
4. The top 2 teams of each group will move on to the Knock-Out Stages. (depending on the grouping).
5. Following stages are Knock-Out Stages. This means that the winner moves to the next stage and the losing team gets put into the loser brackets.
6. Winning condition: In all rounds, you need to knockout all players from the opponent team. The lowest scoring player of every played map gets knocked out from the match. The team that loses all players after consuming all Revives first loses the match.
   - Revive distribution is handled according to point 11 on [General Rules](#general-rules).

Roll winner may decide if they want to ban first and pick 2nd, or pick first and ban 2nd. Bans always happen before picks.
   - Each team is allowed to ban one map out of the entire map pool with the exception of the tiebreaker, which cannot be banned. Each team has to use their ban.
